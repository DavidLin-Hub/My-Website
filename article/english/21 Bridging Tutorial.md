## üèóÔ∏è Quick road tutorial

Hello, Block Adventurer! In wake-up wars and any PvP mini-games, the speed of **Bridge** directly determines how fast you can grab resources, occupy high ground and destroy beds.

Once you master the skills of **Get the road fast**, you will be invincible on the battlefield like a dancer in the void!

### üß± Basic road construction: Safety first (The Safe Way)



This is the easiest and safest way to get on the road, either at high altitudes or when you carry a lot of rare resources.

- **operate:** **Hold down the stealth key (Shift)**, face the direction you want to set up, and then constantly place the square (right mouse button) on the edge of the block.
- **advantage:** is absolutely safe because **You will never fall off the edge** in stealth state.
- **shortcoming:** is extremely slow and is not suitable for PvP scenarios that require racing against time.

### üöÄ Quickly Getting Started: PvP Must Have (Speed ‚Äã‚ÄãBridge)



**Get the road fast** (commonly referred to as **Shift-Release Bridge**) is a must-have skill for all players in wake-up war. It achieves a balance of speed and safety by switching quickly between stealth and sprinting.



#### 1. Core principle: Let go of stealth for a moment



The core of this method is to use the game to still allow you to stand at the edge of the block within the **Very short moment** where you release the stealth key (Shift).

- **posture:** Stand at the edge of the block and look slightly downward (the viewing angle is about 45 degrees, and you can clearly see the sides of the block ahead).
- **Operation rhythm:**
  1. **Hold down the sprint key (Ctrl/default)** and **Forward key (W)**.
  2. **Start stealth (Shift).**
  3. **Precise operation:** **When you place the block, release the stealth key (Shift)**, then **Press Shift again immediately**.



#### 2. Fast angle to get a fast way (fastest)



This is the most commonly used and fastest way to bridge in PvP, as it allows your character to move at the fastest speed on the diagonal.

- **posture:** faces the diagonal direction you want to get (for example, press and hold the **W** and **A/D** keys).
- **operate:** Maintain the same **Shift key release/press** rhythm as the straight line speed, while maintaining the diagonal key (W+A or W+D).
- **Key points:** This method requires extremely high speed and rhythm, and requires a lot of practice to master the perfect synchronization between Shift and the right mouse button.

### üéØ The secret to successfully making a road



No matter which fast-bridge method you use, the following three elements are the key to success:

1. **Perspective angle:** **Don't look vertically down!** Adjust the viewing angle to around 45 degrees so that you can see the blocks you placed and have enough field of view to see if there are enemies around you.
2. **Sense of rhythm:** Quickly getting on the road is a kind of **Rhythmic clicks**. You need to train yourself to synchronize **Release/press the Shift key**, **Right-click to place the square** and **Advance (W)** perfectly.
3. **Sufficient cubes:** Make sure your shortcut bar has **A large number of blocks** (usually wool or end stone) and never let your blocks run out halfway!
