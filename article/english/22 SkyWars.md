## ‚öîÔ∏è SkyWars - Survival, Plunder and Elimination (SkyWars)



congratulations! After mastering the fast track, you are fully prepared to welcome **SkyWars**. This is one of the most popular patterns in Minecraft PvP, which combines **Survive, plunder** and **Fast-paced battle** together.

------

### Goals and Core Mechanisms (The Goal)



Sky Island War is a "battle royale" mode:

- **Target:** **Be the last surviving player** or team.
- **map:** The player was born on his floating island, and the following is the deadly **Void**.
- **mechanism:** Players use blocks to go to the central island and the opponent's island, plundering resources and performing PvP elimination.

> **üí° Key Differences:** Unlike **Get up and fight**, the Sky Island War **No bed**. Once defeated, you will be permanently eliminated.

### üó∫Ô∏è Resource distribution

The resources of the Sky Island War relied entirely on **Chests**. Whoever can plunder faster and more effectively will gain the initiative.



#### 1. Initial Island Treasure Chest (Tier 1)



- **Location:** Your birth island.
- **content:** Provides basic survival requirements: **Wood, stone sword, small amount of iron tools, basic armor (leather or chain), food** and **Squares**.
- **Priority:** **Highest.** You must quickly drive within the first 30 seconds of the game and arm yourself.



#### 2. Central Island Treasure Chest (Tier 2 / Tier 3)



- **Location:** is located in the middle of the map or higher than the initial island.
- **content:** provides rare and advanced resources, including **Diamonds, golden apples, enchantments, bows, potions**, and more advanced **Diamond Armor/Weapon**.
- **Fight for control:** Whoever can control the central island will gain the advantage of enchanting and dominate the battle situation.

### ‚öîÔ∏è Sky Island War: Three-stage victory strategy



A successful Sky Island War strategy requires a balance between **plunder** and **fighting** timing.



#### ü•á Early game (0-1 minute): Quick and armed



1. **Quick unboxing:** Immediately loot all treasure chests on your island. Put **Squares** and **sword** into the shortcut bar.
2. **Getting a quick way:** Use the **Get the road fast** skills you learned in **Chapter 18** to get to the central island or the nearest rival island.
3. **Early match:** If you encounter an opponent, make sure you have **Iron Sword** and **Basic Armor** first. Many players will be shot down in the void while making a journey.



#### ü•à Mid-game (1-5 minutes): Resources and Control



1. **Control Center:** Seize and plunder the treasure chest of the central island. Use **Workbench** to convert the obtained **diamond** and **Enchantment book** into your combat power.
2. **Clean up threats:** Priority is given to solving enemies closest to you and threatening you. Use **Bow and arrow** or **Fireball** to shoot/blast the enemy in the trapped way into the void.
3. **Build a line of defense:** Use blocks to build a simple defensive bunker on the central island.



#### ü•â Late game (after 5 minutes): Potion and end



1. **Potion blessing:** Use the brewing skills you learned in **Chapter 19** or the **Power Potion** or **Invisible Potion** you obtained on the central island to strengthen yourself.
2. **Take the initiative:** Take the initiative to clear the remaining islands and find players who are hiding.
3. **Decisive battle skills:** The final battle often takes place on the central island. Use the **W-Tap** and **Critical strike** skills you master in **PvP Teaching**, and combine the **Golden Apple**'s reply ability to end the opponent!
