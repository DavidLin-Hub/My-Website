## üåô Survival Challenge: Spend the First Night at MINECRAFT



**The real challenge begins now!** You only have about **20 minutes** daytime! After the sun sets, monsters will appear in large numbers, and you will be bare-handed!

Please follow these steps to ensure that your first night is safe:



### üöÄ Your top priority: Enter the 1st minute of the game



When you see the **First second** in this world, the sacred alpaca asks you to complete two tasks that determine life and death immediately:



#### 1. 360¬∞ Look around (Environmental Assessment)



Please quickly look around and evaluate your birthplace:

- **Finding a tree:** **Trees are the cornerstone of your survival.** Confirm where the nearest and easiest tree to be cut.
- **Find food:** Look for animals such as **Pig, cow, sheep**. They are the food source for day one.
- **Look at the sun:** **Confirm the position of the sun.** Remember where it rises and falls, which can help you judge the direction and time.



#### 2. Golden Rules of Survival: **Pull the tree!**



No matter where you are, the first thing you do when you enter the game is to execute my command: **Find a tree and start rubbing it with your fist (long press the left mouse button)!**

------



### ‚è∞ Minutes 1-5: Tree brushing and production workbench



Time is money, and even more so is life! Please quickly complete these two basic steps.



#### Step 1: Pull the tree (get wood)



1. Walk to the nearest tree and destroy the trunk.
2. Collect the dropped **Log (Log)**. You need at least **10-15 logs**.



#### Step 2: Synthesize workbench and wooden pick



1. **Open the backpack (E key)**, converting logs into **Planks**.
2. Use 4 wooden boards to synthesize a **Workbench (Crafting Table)**.
3. Made of wooden boards **Sticks**.
4. **Place the workbench (right mouse button)**, use wooden boards and sticks to synthesize your first tool: **Wooden pick**!

> **üí° Holy Alpaca Tips:** Workbench is your lifeline in the world of Minecraft! All advanced synthesis requires it.



### ‚õèÔ∏è Minutes 5-10: Upgrade the tools and obtain fuel



Muhao is only temporary! We need stronger tools and torches that can illuminate.



#### Step 3: Digging stones and upgrading tools



1. **Start digging:** Use your **Wooden pick** to find a stone (cobblestone/Cobblestone) to start digging.
   - **Quick method:** You can find a flat ground and go straight down **Dig 2-3 grids** until you encounter a stone.
2. **Collecting Targets:** Collect at least **15-20 round stones**.
3. Return to the workbench and upgrade your tools immediately with the boulder and stick:
   - **Stone pick** (Required): Much longer than a wooden pick and dig faster.
   - **Stone Sword** (must-have): Your first weapon to deal with monsters at night.



#### Step 4: Make a furnace and light source



1. **Make a Furnace:** Use 8 round stones to synthesize the furnace.
2. **Make a torch:** Light sources are the key to survival!
   - **There is coal:** Synthesize a torch with coal and wooden sticks.
   - **Coal-free (optional):** Put **log** in **Above the furnace** to fire **Charcoal**, and then use charcoal and wooden sticks to form a torch.
3. **Production objectives:** At least synthesize **8-12 torches**!



### üè° Minutes 10-20: Build a temporary shelter



The sun has begun to sink! This is the most intense stage and absolutely safe must be ensured before dark.



#### Step 5: Build/reinforce the shelter



1. **Find a safe location**:
   - **Plan A (Digging):** Find a mountain and use your stone pickaxe**Dig in 3-4 grid depth** to make sure there are blocks above and around. This is the fastest and safest shelter.
   - **Plan B (build):** If the surroundings are flat, use the round stones you collected to quickly build a simple cottage of **At least 3x3x3 size**.
2. **Setting up doors and light sources:**
   - In the shelter **Insert the torch**, illuminate the interior.
   - Make a **Wooden door** and install it, or use the square **Clog the entrance and all gaps!** directly



#### Step 6: Final preparation and waiting



- In the shelter **Place workbench and furnace**.
- Put your **Raw meat obtained by killing animals** into a furnace and fire it into **Delicatessen** to replenish the hunger value.
- **Wait quietly**. Don't go out when you hear the zombies growl! You are already safe.

**Congratulations, Block Adventurer!** You successfully spent the first night's challenge! Dawn will come soon, when the monsters will burn in the sun and you can safely go out and explore!
