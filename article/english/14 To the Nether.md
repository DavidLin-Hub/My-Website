### üîÆ Step 1: Build a Nether Portal



The lower boundary portal is a frame built with **Obsidian** and activated with fire.



#### 1. Obsidian



- **The only way:** **Let the water flow (Water) contact the flowing magma (Lava).** Flowing magma will turn into obsidian.
- **collection:** **A diamond pick must be used** can only collect obsidian.
- **quantity:** To build a minimum lower bound portal frame, you need **10 obsidians**. To be on the safe side, please prepare **14 pieces**.

#### 2. Build the frame



The smallest size of the lower bound portal is **4 grid width, 5 grid height** (a total of 20 blocks of space).

- **Minimum construction (10 obsidian):** The 2 obsidian at the bottom and 2 obsidian at the top can be replaced with a pebble or any square, so just **10 obsidians** is required. Newbie recommends a complete framework of 14 pieces of obsidian.

- **result:** **Purple swirl-shaped portal block** will appear inside the frame.

### üö® The Golden Rules of Nether Survival (Nether Survival Rules)



When you bravely step into the purple vortex, remember these rules that can save your life:

1. **Protect your door:** **Once you enter the Netherworld, immediately build a protective room with boulders or Netherworld rocks around your portal.** Ghast's fireball may hit and **Destroy your portal**, preventing you from returning to the main world!

2. **Beware of Piglin:**

   - **Don't attack**Any **Adult pig spirit** unless you are ready for a big battle.
   - **Don't open it****Any box or container** near them.
   - **Golden Rules:** In the lower bound, **Please always wear a golden armor** (even a gold helmet). When Zhu Ling sees you wearing gold equipment, she will not attack you actively.
