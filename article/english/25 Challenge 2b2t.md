## üíÄAnarchy Survival Guide‚ÄîChallenge 2b2t (Anarchy Server)

My Block Adventurer, you chose an unprecedented challenge!

**2b2t** is called **"The Oldest Anarchy Server"**, and it is an extremely free, extremely cruel world that is completely different from all the survival and PvP modes we discussed earlier.



### ‚ö†Ô∏è Core mechanism and severe warning



Before entering this world, you must understand and accept the following reality:

1. **Anarchy:** **All actions are allowed** on the server. Players can destroy, steal, maliciously harass and use vulgar language infinitely.
2. **No rules PvP:** The server is filled with **Cheating client** (such as Killaura, Fly Hacks, etc.). Almost all players you encounter may use abnormal means.
3. **Spawn Hell:** The initial birth point has been banned by countless players and explosives**Total destruction**, and resources are almost impossible to obtain.
4. **Queue time:** Due to too many players, non-paying players usually need to go through **Hours or even days waiting in line** to enter the game.

> **Holy Alpaca Stern Warning:** **2b2t is an extremely difficult and extremely hostile environment. If you do not have extremely strong psychological qualities and patience, please do not try it easily.**

### üèÉ Step 1: Escape from the Hellish Birth Spot (Spawn Escape)



Your first task is: **Survive and escape from the birth point of the main world!**

1. **Quick action:** Almost everyone cannot collect any resources near the birth point. You must **Start running now**.
2. **Get food and cubes:** While running quickly, find and collect the **Basic blocks** (cockstones, soil) and **food** (even raw meat) you need.
3. **Use the Gate of Hell:** At the birth point, you will find a large number of **Hell Gate** constructed from obsidian. Going into hell to escape is the most efficient way.
4. **Escape from Hell:**
   - The terrain is complex in hell, but you can use **Hell's 8:1 ratio** to move quickly.
   - **Don't stay**, move it outside **At least 5,000 units** on the main world axis (X/Z) as soon as possible, preferably outside **10,000 units**.

> **üí° Escape Tool:** If you can find **Ender Pearl** in the Birth Point Chest, please use it decisively! It can help you get through obstacles quickly.

### üèïÔ∏è Step 2: Seclusion and Survival Strategy (The Base)



Once you escape the death area around the birth point, survival really begins.

1. **Site selection strategy:**
   - **Stay away from the axis:** **Never** Running straight along the main world axis (X=0 or Z=0) because these places are the easiest to search.
   - **Looking for rare biomes:** Select a base to establish a place such as **Mushroom Island**, **deep sea** or **Remote mountains** that is difficult to detect and difficult to scan.
2. **Base construction:**
   - **Depth Hide:** Your base must be **Completely hidden** and there must be no signs on the ground (such as torches, farmland or obvious entrance).
   - **Resource acquisition:** Since the surrounding environment may have been plundered, you must perform **Branch Mining** to obtain the basic supplies needed to survive.
3. **Storage and security:** Never put all resources in one place. Set **Hidden material points (Stashes)** in different locations.

### üõ°Ô∏è Step 3: Ultimate Survival Skills



On 2b2t, information is life.

1. **Disable map (coordinate security):**
   - **Never share coordinates!** Even if it is you***Best friend***.
   - Don't mention any information about your location or base in the chat unless you trust it very much.
2. **Stay silent:** Try to **Avoid speaking in public chats**. Many senior players record and analyze chat history to find the location of new players.
3. **PvP Coping:** If you meet players, assume they are **Carry a cheating client**.
   - Unless you have overwhelming advantages (such as **Potion** blessing and **Shellfins**), **The primary goal is to escape**.
   - **Use the quick way and bucket tips you have learned** to deal with unexpected battles.
