## ⚠️ Chapter 12: The Golden Rule of Survival- Never dig vertically!



You have learned how to find rare diamonds, and now, the Holy Alpaca will teach you a **The golden safety rules that all old players in Minecraft follow**:

**In survival mode, don't dig the blocks under your feet directly!**



### Why can't you mining vertically? (Three fatal risks)



Mining vertically downward (often called "Dig Straight Down") is the most mortality behavior because it lets you on the situation below **Know nothing**.



#### 1. 🔥 Falling into Lava



- **as a result of:** This is the most common and deadliest way to die. Deep underground, especially near diamond layers (such as Y-level -59), it is easy to encounter huge **Magma lake**.
- **Cause of death:** You will fall directly into the magma and be burned to death within seconds. What's even more terrifying is that all the diamonds, iron tools and precious items on you will be **Burned by magma** and there is no chance of rescue.



#### 2. 💣 Fall into Monsters' Nest (Mob Trap)



- **as a result of:** You may fall directly to the top of **Natural cave**, **Abandoned mine** or **Monster Swipe Cage (Spawner)**.
- **Cause of death:** You will face a siege directly from **Zombies, skeletons, coolie** and will be beaten to death by a group when you have no time to react and defend.



#### 3. 🚧 Face the bedrock layer (you can't go down!)



- **Key clarification:** Bedrock is the world's **The bottom layer** (Y level -64), and you are **Can't destroy it with any pickaxe** in survival mode.
- **Real risks:** If you dig vertically down, even if you end up encountering undestructible bedrock, there is a good chance that you have fallen into **Magma lake above bedrock** before that. You never know what is hidden under the square under your feet, safety first!

### ✅ Correct and safe way to dig down: Z-shaped staircase method



In order to safely reach the mineral layer (such as Y level -59), always use the following safe digging method:

- **principle:** Dig only one block's height downward at a time, and ensure that there is always solid block support under your feet.
- **operate:** Always dig **Two squares in front** to form a diagonal downhill that can **Return the same route** (like a Z-shaped staircase).
- **benefit:** This way you can always see the situation below. Once you find magma or monster, you can immediately place a block under your feet, or jump back to the previous layer.

> **remember:** Never take your foothold as the goal you want to destroy! In Minecraft, **Safety is more important than efficiency**!
