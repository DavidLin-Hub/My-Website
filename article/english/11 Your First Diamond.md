### ‚õèÔ∏è Prerequisite for mining: iron pickaxe! (The Prerequisite)



The Holy Alpaca wants to remind you that if you want to get diamonds, **Must use Iron Pickaxe or higher pick** to dig.

- **Key Warning:** If you use a stone pick or wooden pick to hit the diamond mine, the ore will be directly damaged. **Nothing will fall!** Make sure you are holding an iron pick.

### üó∫Ô∏è Where are the diamonds hidden? (Where to Find Diamonds)



Diamonds are very rare in the Minecraft world, and they only appear at specific underground depths.



#### Find the best Y coordinates for diamonds (height)



- **If you are playing version 1.18 and later (modern):**
  - The optimal depth is **Y level -59**.
  - Diamonds are the most densely distributed in the deepest deep slate area in the world. **The closer you get to the underground bedrock, the more you get!**
- **If you are playing old versions (1.17 and before):**
  - The optimal depth is **Y Level 11-12**.
  - This is a traditional mining site, generally located above a large natural magma lake.

> **üí° Holy Alpaca Tips:** Press **F3 key** to view your coordinates at any time. Look for the value after `Y:`, which is your current height.

### üõ°Ô∏è Safe and efficient mining method: branch mine track



Since the diamonds are hidden deep underground, it is less efficient to directly explore dangerous natural caves. The best way is to use **Branch Mining**:

1. **Dig down to the target depth:** Use a Z-shaped staircase or spiral passage to dig your target safely to the ground **Y level (recommended -59)**.
2. **Main mine track:** Dig out a long, 2 grid-height and 1 grid-width **Main mine** at the target Y level and insert torches along the way.
3. **Branch:** Starting from both sides of the main mine channel, **Every 3 grids**, dig out **Branch mine track** parallel to the main mine channel.
   - **principle:** This maximizes the coverage of the blocks around you, ensuring you don't miss any diamond mines!
4. **Be careful of magma!** In the depths of the world, magma lakes are very common. When you hear the sound of magma flowing, **Be sure to slow down and dig the sides of the two squares in front of you** instead of digging the blocks under your feet directly to avoid falling into the magma.
