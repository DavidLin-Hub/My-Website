- **Login requirements:** Some private servers will turn off genuine verification (i.e. **Offline Mode**) to facilitate friends, allowing players of **Log in offline** to join.
- **⚠️ Risk Warning:** When this server is online, if the player's nickname conflicts with the genuine player's nickname, it may cause the item to be lost or the progress is inconsistent. **In small servers that you are unfamiliar or distrust, it is highly recommended not to use offline login!**
