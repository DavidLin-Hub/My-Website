## ðŸ‘‚Defeat The Warden

My Block Adventurer, you're about to face the scariest creature in Minecraft: **The Warden**. Unlike other bosses, the persistent design philosophy is **Encourage players to escape and stealth**, not a head-on battle.

This tutorial will provide a **Used for life-threatening or extreme challenges** strategy, but remember: **The safest strategy is never to alarm it.**

------



### 1. The Power of the Persistence: The Threats You Must Know



The Persistence has extremely high health (500 blood, more than twice as much as wither) and extremely high melee damage. The threat mainly comes from the following points:

- **Totally Blind:** It can't see you, but it has **Strong hearing and smell**. Any sound, vibration or smell (player within 20 blocks) will attract it.
- **Ultrasonic Boom:** This is its deadliest ranged attack. It can **Penetrating armor and blocks**, causing huge damage. Stand behind a wall or on a pillar **Cannot** to protect you from this attack.
- **Darkness:** When the Persister is nearby, you will be subjected to the "dark" effect and your vision will be greatly weakened, making the battle more difficult.



### 2. Pre-war preparation: Configuration for high-intensity combat



Due to persistent damage like Persisters **Immune to most knockbacks** and **Immune flame/withering**, your strategy must revolve around **Instantly high explosion** and **Defensive penetration**.

- **armor:** **Full set of enchanted Netherworld Alloy Armor**, Enchantment: **Protect IV**. This is the only guarantee for hard-hitting melee and ultrasonic damage.
- **arms:**
  - **Remote output:** **Enchanted bow or crossbow** (Enchant: Power V/Multi-Shot).
  - **Key ammunition:** **Arrow of Harming II**. This is one of the best output methods, because the damage is fixed, **And can penetrate its defense**. Prepare at least **30 pieces**.
- **Potion:**
  - **Life Recovery Type II Potion:** The more, the better, used to quickly make up for the health value knocked out by ultrasonic waves.
  - **Power II Potion:** Increase your remote output.
- **Bait:** A large number of **Snowball, arrow or egg**.



### 3. Winning strategy: control and remote consumption



In combat, you have to use the blind trait of the Persister to control its position.



#### A. Build Trap (optional, but recommended)



Before alarming the holder, dig a **moat** or **Secret room** near **Ancient City**.

- **principle:** A trench or chamber can **temporary** block its melee attacks and give you room for long-range shooting.
- **Notice:** Don't expect it to stop ultrasound, it will only give you a breath.



#### B. Induce attack and shooting



1. **Start the war:** Drink the potion of strength. Use **Snowball** or **Ordinary arrows** to shoot away from you. Persistencers will give priority to chasing the nearest **sound**.
2. **position:** When the defender is attracted by the bait and his back is facing you, start shooting with **Instant damage type II arrow**.
3. **Dodge ultrasound:** The persistent person is ready to emit ultrasound. When you see this action, you should **Run and dodge immediately** to reduce damage. Remember, ultrasonic waves **Can't be blocked by blocks**.
4. **Keeping distance and sound management:**
   - **Making noise bait** is the key to your survival. Always throw the bait at **The opposite direction to you** and let the stickers turn their backs to you.
   - **Don't stand still:** Continuously move, which helps avoid its slow but extremely high damage melee attacks.
