## ✨Enchanting Basics





### What is enchantment? (What is Enchanting?)



Enchanting is the core gameplay of Minecraft's later survival. When you are tired of repeatedly synthesizing new tools and armor, enchantment is the key to elevating your **Diamond Equipment** to **Extraordinary power**!

- **nature:** Enchantment is to give your magic attributes (Enchantments) tools, weapons or armor, giving them special abilities (such as faster digging speed, higher damage, and stronger defense).

### 🔮 The premise of enchanting: preparation



Before you cast your magic, you need to collect the following three mysterious materials:



#### 1. Enchanting Table



You've learned to make it in the previous chapter. It is like an "altar" of magical power.

- **Synthetic materials:** **3 diamonds** + **4 obsidians** + **1 book**.

#### 2. Lapis Lazuli



Lapis lazuli is enchanted **"fuel"**. Each enchantment requires some lapis lazuli.

- **Get:** Collect ore with **Blue spots** in underground mine caves. Collect with any pickaxe.
- **use:** Put in the second slot of the enchantment table.

#### 3. Experience Levels (XP)



The experience level is enchanted **"cost"**. Enchantments will consume your current level of experience.

- **Get:** Kill monsters, mine, burn items, fish, etc.
- **Notice:** **The highest level enchantment (level 30)** Although only 3 levels of experience is consumed, it requires you to currently have **Level 30** or above to show it.

### 📚 Create a full-level enchantment room (The Max Setup)



The enchantment platform itself can be enchanted, but it can only provide low-level magic. To unlock the most powerful **Level 30 Enchantment**, you need a special **Enchantment room**:

1. **Prepare bookshelf:** You need to make **15 Bookshelves**.

   - **Bookshelf recipe:** 6 boards + 3 books.

2. **Placement rules:**

   - Place the enchantment table in the room **center**.
   - Place **15 bookshelves** around the enchantment table, **Leave 1 space** (a square surrounded with side length 5x5, no need to place on the corner).
   - The height of the bookshelf must be with the enchantment table **Level** or **higher**.

> **💡 Holy Alpaca Tips:** If you see the enchantment option for **Level 30** on the enchantment platform, prove that your bookshelf is placed correctly! If you want to downgrade the enchantment (for example, you only need level 1 or level 5 enchantment), you can use the gap between the **Torch or carpet** temporarily **Block** part of the bookshelf and the enchantment stand.
