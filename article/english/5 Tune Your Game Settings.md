## Optimize your gaming experience: Basic configuration tutorial



Congratulations! You have successfully started the game. Before we start our exciting adventure, we need to adjust some basic settings to make your gaming experience more comfortable.



### 🔊 Basic settings: sound effects, language and mouse



After adjusting the performance (if you haven't adjusted it before), these basic settings will make your gaming experience more comfortable:



#### 🖱️ Control settings (Controls)



- **Mouse Sensitivity:** This is a subjective value, please adjust it to the extent you feel **Aim to comfort** (usually between 50% - 100%, too high sensitivity may cause you to be unable to target the monster accurately).
- **Change the keys:** If you are used to sneaking with other keys, opening your backpack or using items, you can make changes based on your personal habits in this menu.



#### 🗣️ Language Settings (Language)



- **Modify language:** If your game is displayed in English, click **"Options"** -> **"Language"**, then scroll down to find **“Simplified Chinese (China)”** and click to switch.
- **Force Unicode fonts:** If the Chinese characters are not displayed properly, try to enable **"Force Unicode Font"** in the language settings.



#### 🔈 Music & Sounds



- **Music volume:** Minecraft's background music is very classic, but if you feel distracted, you can turn the volume of **“Music (Music)”** separately in **“Music & Sounds”**.
- **Ambient sound effects:** **“Friendly creatures”**, **"Cubic"**, **"weather"** and other sound effects are the key to judging the surrounding environment. It is recommended to maintain medium and high volumes.
