## Chapter 1: Hello, welcome to the official website of Alpaca Guide

**Hello, new block adventurer!**

We are **Alpaca Guide**, and Iâ€™m glad you chose us as your first stop to explore **MINECRAFT**!

Do you think this world is a bit... big? A little...complex? Don't worry! We know that stepping into a world full of zombies, **Coolie** and endless mines feels like being thrown into a dark forest. But don't be afraid, we are like furry and warm **Alpaca**, which will use the softest and clearest "fluff guide" to illuminate the road ahead.

### âœ… Our Commitment: Soft and Clear Guide

In **Alpaca Guide**, you won't see complicated terms or lengthy tutorials that make people want to sleep. We promise:

- **Newbie friendly:** Our tutorial starts with the most basic **"How to move"**, ensuring that you can easily get started even with zero foundation.
- **Warm and reliable:** I will teach you how to get through the crucial **"First Night"** and safely build your first **Shelter**.
- **Continuous company:** Whether you want to learn to synthesize a pickaxe or want to know how to go to the mine safely, I will be the alpaca companion beside you who makes the **"Gulugulu"** sound.
