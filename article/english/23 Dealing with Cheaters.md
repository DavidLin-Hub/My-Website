### What is a cheating client?



Hacked Clients are special clients that modify Minecraft game code, which allows players to use features that are otherwise impossible in the game to gain unfair advantages.



#### Common cheating features (you want to identify and stay away from)



- All entities within the range **Killaura / Killing Halo:** **Automatic lock and attack**. This is the most common cheating, and cheaters do not need to aim or click on it themselves.
- **Fly / Fly & Speed ​​/ Sprint:** Allows players to move in the air or at a speed that is far beyond normal running in non-creative mode.
- **Aimbot / Automatic aiming:** Automatically lock and track the player, ensuring extremely high hit rate for bows, snowballs or pearls.

### What to do if you encounter a cheater?



On a PvP server, you will sooner or later encounter players using these software. Remember, your goal is to stay calm and impartial.



#### 1. **Don't fight, give priority to evacuation**



- **Keep distance:** If you suspect your opponent is cheating, **Stop fighting with him immediately**. You can't beat a cheater with normal skills.
- **Utilize terrain:** Quickly use terrain, water or blocks to keep your distance and ensure your survival.



#### 2. **Collect evidence and report it immediately (Report)**



Reporting is the only way to maintain fairness in the game environment.

- **Server command:** Most servers have built-in reporting instructions, usually `/report [玩家昵称]`.
- **Recording video:** **The most effective evidence.** If possible, use screen recording software to record the abnormal behavior of cheating players (for example: ultra-high-speed clicks, you can hit you without watching, stay still in the air, etc.).
- **Submit evidence:** Submit the recorded video and cheating player's nickname to the server's official forum or customer service channel.
