### üîÆ Step 1: Create Eye of Ender



To find and enter **The End**, you need a special "tracker" to locate the hidden portal: **Ending Eye**.



#### 1. Collect materials (End and Flame Man)

  - **source:** Kill the **Enderman** drop generated by the main world at night.
  - **warn:** The ender will fight back only if it is attacked or you look it in the eye!
- **Blaze Rod:**
  - **source:** Kill \**Blaze** in **Nether Fortress\** and drop it.
  - **hint:** The Flame Man is the key monster you must find after entering the Netherworld.



#### 2. Synthetic ending eye



1. **Make Flame Powder:** In a workbench or backpack, convert **Flame rod** to **Blaze Powder** (1 stick = 2 portions of powder).
2. **synthesis:** In the center of the workbench, synthesize **1 serving of flame powder** and **1 ender pearl** to obtain **1 Ending Eye**.

### üó∫Ô∏è Step 2: Find the Fortress (The Stronghold)



The end portal is hidden in a naturally generated structure deep underground - **fortress**.

1. **Start tracking:** On the main world surface, use **Ending Eye** against the sky **Right-click**.
2. **Follow the guidance:** The ending eye will fly upwards and then hang in the air, pointing in the nearest **fortress** direction.
3. **Repeat throws:** Follow the direction it guides, and every distance (about 100-200 squares) there is an ending eye to confirm the direction.
4. **Dig down:** When the ending eye no longer flies into the distance, but **Punch down directly into the ground**, it means **The fortress is right below you**!
5. **explore:** Dig down carefully and enter the intricate fortress. Explore along the corridor until you find **End Portal Room**.

### üö™ Step 3: Activate the End Portal



The end portal is a ring structure composed of **12 End Portal Frames**.

1. **Fill the eye groove:** You will find that some frames already have the Ending Eyes, put your prepared **Ending Eye** into all **No** Ending Eyes **In the framework of**.
2. **Portal activation:** When the last eye groove is filled, a **Still black portal block** will appear in the center of the frame.

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Key tips:** **Please be fully prepared before entering the portal!** Once you enter, you will be unable to look back until you defeat the End Dragon or die! Bring your **Bow and arrow**, **A large number of blocks**, **Golden Apple** and **Enchanted God Sword** with you!

### ‚öîÔ∏è Step 4: The Final Battle



Entering the end, you will enter a huge floating island composed of **End Stone**. The center of the island is the ultimate boss‚Äî**The End Dragon**!



#### 1. First goal: destroy the ending crystal!



The health of the final dragon will continue to recover through **Ender Crystals** surrounding the island. Without destroying them, the battle will be endless.

- **operate:** Your first priority is **Destroy all 10 ending crystals**.
- **method:** Most of the crystals are located at the top of **Obsidian Pillar**, and you can use **Bow and arrow** or **Snowball/Egg** to shoot them.
  - There is **2 crystals** protected by iron railings, you need to climb up or build blocks to the top of the obsidian column and destroy it with **Melee**.
- **Danger Warning:** When the crystal is destroyed, it will cause **Violent explosion**! Please make sure to evacuate quickly after shooting or sabotage at a safe distance.

#### 2. Defeat the End Dragon
