### ü™ô Resource system: four core currencies



The economy of wake-up war is built on four resources that determine the props you can buy and the strength of the team.



#### 1. Base currency (generated within the base)



- **Iron Ingot:** The most basic currency used to purchase **Squares, basic swords, food, scissors** and basic armor.
- **Gold Ingot:** More advanced currency used to purchase **Bow, fireball, ultimate pickaxe** and **Better armor**.



#### 2. Rare Currencies (Central Area Generation)



- **Diamond:** Used to purchase **Permanent team upgrade** in **Upgrade the store** within the base (such as stronger armor protection, faster resource generation).
- **Emerald:** The rarest currency, generated in the map **Central Island**. Used to purchase **The most powerful prop** such as **Ender pearls, powerful potion** and **obsidian** (the best bed protection materials).

### üõí Store Guide: Props and Team Buffs



There are two stores at your base, and using them rationally is the key to victory.



#### 1. Item Shop: Battle and Defense Props



- **Must-buy cubes:** **Wool**. It is the cheapest and fastest to build, and is the first choice for early runaways and basic defense.
- **Core tools:** **Shears**. It can quickly remove the enemy's wool bed defense and is a must-have for attack.
- **Offensive artifact:** **Fireball**. You can quickly explode the enemy's defense line, or blow the enemy who is building a bridge into the void.



#### 2. Upgrade Shop: Team Gain



- **Purchase priority:** Use **diamond** to purchase team gains, and the effect will be effective permanently on all teammates.
  1. **Protection:** **The highest priority!** Improve the armor level and is the core of PvP's victory or defeat.
  2. **Emergency (Haste):** Increases excavation speed, helps to quickly collect resources and decompose beds.
  3. **Resource Acceleration (Generators):** Accelerate the generation speed of iron and gold ingots.

### ‚öîÔ∏è Battlefield Strategy: The Road to Victory from Zero to One





#### ü•á Early game (0-5 minutes): Defense and resources



1. **First task: bed defense!** Collect enough iron ingots, buy a large amount of **wool**, and wrap your bed tightly in **At least two layers**.
2. **Basic equipment:** Buy a handful of **Iron Sword** and **Iron pickaxe**.
3. **Control Diamonds:** Build the block as soon as possible and go to the nearest **Diamond Generation Point** to purchase **Protection I** upgrades for the team.



#### ü•à Mid-game (5-15 minutes): Attack and upgrade



1. **Team Upgrade Priority:** Concentrate resource purchase **Protection III or IV**, which is the guarantee of mid-term PvP victory.
2. **Emerald scramble:** Build to **Central Island** to collect emeralds. Use it to purchase **Ending pearl** or **obsidian** to upgrade your bed defense.
3. **Launch a reconnaissance attack:** Take **Fireballs, scissors** and enough blocks to attack the team closest to you or the weakest bed defense.



#### ü•â Late game (15 minutes later): The final battle



1. **Remove hard protection:** If the enemy's bed defense is obsidian, you need to use **The ultimate pickaxe (diamond pickaxe)** to remove it.
2. **Potion blessing:** The purchase of **Invisible Potion** and **Power Potion** using emeralds will give you an absolute advantage in the final single or team showdown.
3. **Precise elimination:** After destroying all beds, use **Bow and arrow** or **Fireball** to shoot down the remaining enemy players to the void and complete the final elimination.
