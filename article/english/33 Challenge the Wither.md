## ðŸ’€ Battle of Wither

My Block Adventurer, you have completed the penultimate challenge of your survival journey: defeating **Wither (The Wither)**. This boss, summoned by three withered skulls and four soul sand, is far more difficult than the end dragon.

This tutorial will provide the safest, most effective, and original mechanism based **A winning strategy**.

------



### 1. Pre-war preparation: foolproof configuration

Withered attacks with **"Wind" effect** will continuously reduce your health and armor. You must be fully prepared, especially for defense and output against melee attacks.



#### A. Equipment requirements (minimum requirements)

- **arms:** **Enchanted Diamond Sword or Nether Alloy Sword** must be enchanted with **Smite V (Smite V)**. The Undead Killer has an extra huge amount of damage to the Withering, which is the key to defeating it.
- **armor:** **Full set of enchanted Netherworld Alloy Armor**, the enchantment level reaches at least **Protection IV (Protection IV)**.
- **Potion:**
  - **Life Recovery Type II Potion:** At least 6 bottles, used to quickly pull back the bloodline when the withering effect is weakened.
  - **Power II Potion:** 1 bottle, drink before the war begins, maximize melee output.
  - **Anti-gun potion water:** 1 bottle to prevent ignition by withering and explosions in the lower boundary or deep underground.
- **food:** **Golden Apple** or **Enchanted Golden Apple**, the more the better, it is used for emergency blood recovery.
- **Summoning Materials:** 4 pieces **Soul Sand\** and 3 pieces\**Wither Skeleton Skull**.



### 2. Win strategy: Use Bedrock Trap

**It is extremely unwise to fight withering in open areas or on the ground!** You must use the game mechanic to trap it in a position that cannot be moved or destroyed.



#### A. Choose battlefield and trap

The battlefield chosen must be able to limit the movement of wither and protect you from environmental damage:

1. **Nether Roof:**
   - **Advantages:** Withering in the generation stage **Unable to destroy bedrock**. If its head can be stuck under the bedrock, it will not enter the second stage (immunized to long-range attacks), becoming a living target.
   - **method:** Below the bedrock at the top of the lower bound, find an area with **Three continuous bedrocks** above the head and set up a trap here.
2. **Deep underground:**
   - **Advantages:** is relatively easy to reach.
   - **risk:** is around Y coordinate 11, and the surroundings are surrounded by **obsidian** or **Bedrock**. Withering will slowly **Dig through obsidian**, the combat space is small and easy to be damaged by explosions.



#### B. Build a card trap (the top of the following boundary is used as an example)

1. **position:** Find a location with a continuous arrangement of **Three bedrocks** on the top below the bedrock layer.
2. **Build:** Build a small airtight room with **Obsidian or other hard squares** as a trap in the place 2 cubicles below the bedrock.
3. **core:** There must be these three bedrocks above the trap. This is the key to the withered head stuck.



### 3. Battle stage: summoning, carding and output



#### A. Summoning (Activation)

1. **place:** Put the soul sand structure of **T-shaped** in the trap.
2. **activation:** Place the third head on the top, and withering begins to generate (life bar appears, the head flickers).
3. **get away:** **Quickly escape from the trap and block the exit**.



#### B. Card and output (Phase 2)

- **Card check:** Withering will try to move upward during generation. If the trap is built correctly, the withered **Three heads** will be overhead bedrock **stuck**.
- **Output flow:**
  - Drink **Strength II Potion**.
  - Enter the trap and use **Undead Killer V Sword** to target the withered center block for continuous attacks.
  - **Life Management:** Pay close attention to your health and withering effects. When the bloodline is less than half, **Drink Life Recovery II Potion immediately** or **Eat golden apples**.



#### C. Defeat

Continue attack until it witheres and explodes, dropping **Nether Star**. The explosion is extremely powerful and may hurt you even if it is stuck. Please be vigilant.



### 4. Post-war handling

- **collect:** Collect the dropped **The Netherworld Star** immediately for synthesis of **Beacon**.
- **Evacuation:** If fighting at the top of the Nether, evacuate as soon as possible and fix any changes you have made to enter the top of the bedrock.

Congratulations, my adventurer! Now you have received the core material of the most powerful reward in the game - **Beacon**. You're already at the top of Minecraft!
