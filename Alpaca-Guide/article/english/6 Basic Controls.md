## 🏃 Basic operations: movement, perspective and block interaction



congratulations! You have successfully entered this world of blocks full of infinite possibilities. Now, it’s time to learn how to control your body and hands! Remember these keys, they are your "alpaca reins" in the Minecraft world.



### 🧭 Movement and vision (your "four hooves" and "head")



These are the keys to your control of character actions and observe the environment.

- **Forward/Reverse/Left/Left:** Default key **W/S/A/D** key. This is the basis for you to control your walking direction.
- **jump:** Default button **Space bar (Space)**. Used to cross obstacles that are high or jump onto the platform.
- **Run (accelerate):** **Press and hold the default Ctrl key**. This will allow you to run faster, but will consume hunger value.
- **Sneak:** Default button **Shift key**.
  - **Super important!** Stealing lets you **It won't fall off the edge of the block**. Be sure to hold it when you are on the edge of a cliff or at a high altitude!
  - Stealing will also make your character model slightly shorter and reduce the chances of monsters discovering you.
- **Adjust the perspective:** **Mouse movement**. Like your "head", control where you look.



### ⛏️ Interaction with backpack (your “hands” and “fluffy backpack”)



These are the ways you interact with everything in the world and manage items.

- **Destruction/attack:** **Left mouse button (long press)**. Press and hold **Digging blocks** for a long time (such as picking a tree), and clicking on creatures is an attack.
- **Place blocks/use items:** **Right mouse button**. Just right-click the square in your hand. Right-click to use the workbench, furnace or door.
- **Open the backpack/synthesis:** **E key**. Your "big fluffy backpack"! Manage items and carry-on synthesis are all done here.
- **Shortcut bar switch:** **Number keys 1 - 9**. Quickly switch items in the shortcut bar at the bottom of your backpack (bottom of the screen).
- **Discard items:** **Q key**. Used to quickly discard items selected in your hand.
