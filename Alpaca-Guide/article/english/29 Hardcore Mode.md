## üíÄ Hardcore Mode



My Block Adventurer, you are already at the peak of survival mode! **Hardcore Mode\** is provided by Minecraft \**The ultimate challenge**. Here, every mistake can make you lose everything.

This is an independent difficulty option and once selected, you won't be able to look back.

### üö® Core Mechanism: Never Resurrection (One Life)



The main difference between extreme mode and normal survival mode is its **Permanent death** penalty:

1. **Permanent lock difficulty:** The game difficulty is permanently locked to **Hard** and cannot be changed. This means that hunger values ‚Äã‚Äãare consumed faster, monsters are stronger, and zombies are more likely to break the door.
2. **Only once life:** Once your health is zero (whether it is defeated by monsters, fall into voids or fall into magma), your world will be **Permanent lock**.
3. **The end of the world:** After death, you cannot be resurrected. You can only choose **"Watch the World"** (Spectate World), or **Delete the world**. All your efforts will end with your death.

> **üí° Holy Alpaca Warning:** The limit mode tests your **Patient, cautious** and **Knowledge reserve**. Every mining, every bridge, every battle must be perfect.

### üõ°Ô∏è The golden rule of survival in extreme mode



In the extreme mode, survival is no longer "how to develop", but "how not to make mistakes".



#### 1. Caution is first: slow is fast



- **Vertical mining ban:** **Never dig vertically down or upward.** This is the most common way of death (falling into magma)
- **Arrange in advance:** Any exploration before entering a cave, lower realm or end must be carried out under the protection of **Full set of enchanted diamond armor** and **Potion**.
- **Double protection:** Your base must have **Double walls, double doors** and **Enough lighting**. Don't be stingy with your torch!



#### 2. Food and Health Management



- **Saturation priority:** Under extreme difficulty, the hunger value drops extremely quickly. Preferential consumption of foods that can provide the highest **Saturation** (for example **Cooked steak, cooked pork chop**).
- **Automatic Farm:** Once resources allow, set up **Fully automatic farm** as soon as possible (for example: automatic roast chicken farm) to ensure you will never face food shortages.
- **Golden Apple Strategy:** **Synthesize as many golden apples as possible** (Golden Apple). They are **The ultimate life-saving tactic** that instantly recover life during combat in extreme mode and provide key life recovery buffs.



#### 3. Avoid high-risk environments



- **Stay away from the void:** In the lower boundary and end, **Never build a bridge above the void**. Either use **sneak** or build **Tunnel with guardrail**.
- **Avoid creepers:** The explosion of the Kuliver is enough to instantly kill players without protection IVs at extreme difficulty. Hear **Hissing**, **Turn around and run away immediately** or **Block with a shield**.
- **Water Bucket Clutch:** You must place **bucket** in the shortcut bar and master the skills of **Splashing water to offset fall damage** when falling.

### üöÄ Challenge the end of the game: extreme clearance goal



In extreme mode, defeating the end of the final dragon represents the player's highest honor.

1. **Equipment requirements:** Must have **Full set of enchanted Netherworld Alloy Armor** (Protect IV, Thorns, etc.) and **Enchanted Netherworld Alloy Sword** (Sharp V).
2. **Potion reserve:** Must carry **Strength II Spray Potion**, **Life Recovery II Spray Potion** and **Long-term fireproof water**.
3. **End Strategy:**
   - **When clearing crystals, you must use obsidian to build a protective wall**, prevent the collision of the final dragon from knocking you away.
   - **Don't take too much risk**. After killing the End Dragon, before the Elysia is gone, **don't want** try to explore the End.

Extreme mode is the ultimate test of all your skills. Good luck and may your world last forever!
