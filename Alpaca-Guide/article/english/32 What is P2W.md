## ‚ùì P2W Explanation: What is "paid victory"?



My Block Adventurer, you come up with a concept that is crucial in all free game modes: **P2W**.

**P2W** is the abbreviation of the English phrase **"Pay-to-Win"**, which is literally translated as **"Pay to win"** or **"Spend money to win"**.

In Minecraft's online servers and many online games, this is a **derogatory term** used to accuse unfair payment mechanisms in game design.

### 1. The core definition of P2W



P2W refers to a game mode or mechanism:

- **Core advantages:** Players can purchase items, abilities or privileges that directly affect the balance of the game by spending **Real currency (recharge)**.
- **Destroy balance:** The advantages obtained by these payments give paid players ("Krypton players") an overwhelming advantage over non-paid players ("civilian players") in **fair play**.
- **result:** Winning, ranking or rapid development in the game depends mainly on **Thickness of the player's wallet**, not **Tips, time and effort**.



### 2. P2W performance in Minecraft server



In some online servers (especially some of the mini-game servers in the Chinese version we discussed earlier), the P2W mechanism may include:

- **PvP Advantages:** Purchase **Weapons or armor with higher enchantment levels and stronger attributes** that is more than ordinary players can obtain, or obtain **Unique combat skills**.
- **Development advantages:** Purchase **Faster resource generation speed** and **Permanently effective and self-efficient enchantment collection tool** to significantly reduce development time.
- **Privileged directive:** Purchase the command of **Set a transfer point at any time in the base** so that paying players can escape or return to the battlefield faster.

### 3. The difference between P2W and fair game



Not all paid content is P2W. We must distinguish between paid items for the game balance **influential** and **No impact**:

- **Acceptable Paid (Aesthetics and Convenience):** This type of paid purchase content**No impact** game value balance. For example, purchase **Special skin, chat colors, pets** or **Warehouse capacity expansion** (does not affect PvP attributes). **Such payments are generally accepted by the community**.
- **P2W paid (numerical crush):** This type of paid purchase content**Direct impact** Combat power, resource acquisition speed or core game mechanism. For example, buy **Power potion effect permanently** or **Exclusive resource points**.

**Summarize:** In Minecraft, it is considered P2W only if paid content allows you to get **Numerical crushing** in PvP or Survival Contest.

You have mastered the concept of P2W! This is an important criterion for distinguishing between excellent servers and bad servers.
