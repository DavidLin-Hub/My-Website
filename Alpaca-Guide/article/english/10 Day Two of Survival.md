## üìÖ Spend the second day (Day Two)





### ü©∑ Welcome back, my adventurer!



congratulations! You survived the most critical first night of Minecraft! The Holy Alpaca is proud of you!

When you walk out of the shelter and see zombies burning in the sun, **Coolie** fleeing around in panic, you know: **You won the first round!**

Now, it is time to upgrade your survival from "barely sustain" to "stable development". The theme of the second day is: **Coal, food and finding a new home!**

------



### Goal 1: **Food and Hunger Value Management**



After spending your first night, your **Hunger value (üçó chicken leg icon)** may have dropped. **Hunger value not only affects your running ability, but also makes it impossible for you to recover your health when it drops to a certain level.**.

#### 1. Hunting and Cooking (Get Cooked Meat)



- **action:** Hunt nearby **Pig, cow, sheep, chicken** and other animals and use your **Stone Sword** to attack them.
- **Notice:** **Never eat raw meat!** It can only restore a very small amount of hunger and risk causing you to be poisoned.
- **cooking:** Put all **Raw Meat** into **furnace**, use **Coal/charcoal** as fuel, and bake them into **Cooked meat**. The hunger value of cooked meat recovered is several times that of raw meat!

#### 2. Begin to farm (agricultural basics)



1. **Making a hoe:** In the workbench, combine a handful of **Wooden hoe** with 2 sticks and 2 boards or round stones.
2. **Building farmland:** In **Near the water source**, right-click **soil** with **hoe** and turn it into **arable land**.
3. **sowing:** Plant the **seed** you collected (destroy the grass drop). **Notice:** The farmland must be close to water (with water flow within 4 nearby blocks) to remain moist (shown as dark), otherwise the seeds will pop up.

### Target 2: **Resource upgrades‚Äîtoward the Iron Age**



The Stone Age is over! If you want to start a real mineral exploration, you need a stronger tool - **Iron pickaxe**.



#### 1. Find coal and iron ore (Mining)



- **Looking for a mine cave:**
  - **Mining down the stairs**: In or next to your shelter, dig down a **Z-shaped** or **Spiral** staircase. **(Note: Do not dig the blocks under your feet vertically!** Otherwise you may fall into magma or mine cave).
  - **Explore open-pit mine caves**: In search of the world during the day**Exposed cave**.
- **Collection priority:**
  1. **Coal:** Stone with **black** spots. Collect with any pickaxe. **(Maximum priority!** It is the only stable source for making **Torch**, you can't explore mines without torches).
  2. **Iron Ore:** Stone with **Beige/light brown** spots. **Must be collected with a stone pickaxe or a higher-level pickaxe.** Iron is a huge improvement in survival.

> **üí° Holy Alpaca Tips:** The collected **Iron ore** cannot be used directly! You need to use **furnace** to burn it into **Iron Ingot** to make the tool!



#### 2. Synthetic iron tools



Once you have cooked enough **Iron ingot**, make the following items immediately:

- **Iron Pickaxe:** Ability to mine higher-level minerals such as **Gold, diamonds, redstones, lapis lazuli**. **This is your second survival milestone!**
- **Iron Sword:** Powerful weapons that make you more easily deal with monsters.
- **Iron Bucket:** Being able to scoop **water** and **magma** is a key tool for farmland, extinguishing fires, and exploring hell.

------



### Goal 3: **Find a permanent home**



Once you have food, pickaxes and basic tools, it‚Äôs time to leave your humble ‚Äúone-night home‚Äù and find a place with more resources and suitable for long-term development.

- **Characteristics of an ideal home:**

  - **Water source**: There are rivers or lakes nearby, which are convenient for building farmland.
  - **Flat terrain**: Convenient to building houses and ranches.
  - **Resource diversity**: It is best to be nearby **forest** (wood), **Mountains** (many ore) and **Desert/Plain** (convenient to construction).
