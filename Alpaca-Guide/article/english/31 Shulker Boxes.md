## ðŸŽ’ Shulker Box

My Block Adventurer, you have mastered all the core skills of fighting and survival. Now, it's time to solve an eternal puzzle that has bothered all Minecraft players: **Not enough backpack!**

**Shulker Box** is the game **The most powerful storage container**, which can completely change the way you manage your resources.

------



### 1. What is a hidden shadow box? (Backpack in backpack)

The appearance of the shadow box looks like a purple, slowly opening and closing box, and it has two game-changing core features:

- **Keep contents:** When you place the hidden shadow box **Destroy or collect**, the **27 item slots** stored internally will not be cleared, but **Keep intact** is in the hidden shadow box.
- **Stackable boxes:** This means you can put a shadow box into another normal box, or more importantly - **Put a shadow box full of resources into your backpack**!
  - (Imagine: your backpack slot can now hold 27 sets of diamonds!)



### 2. Core material: acquisition of hidden shadow shell

The synthesis of the shadow box depends on a unique drop: **Shulker Shell**.



#### A. Find End City

- **Prerequisites:** You must have defeated **The End Dragon** and entered **External end island** through the End Flip Gate.
- **Target location:** **End City** in the distance. Remember, only the end of **With the end ship** mentioned in **Chapter 17** will generate more intensely.



#### B. Kill Shulker

- **monster:** **Hidden Shadow** are unique monsters in the End. They disguise themselves as blocks and fire bullets with **Floating effect**.
- **Drop rate:** Each hidden shadow has **50% chance** drops **1 hidden shadow shell**.
- **suggestion:** The hidden shadow can be pushed by **piston** or damaged by **Potion**. When cleaning up the end, bringing **Enchanted bow and arrow** and **Resistance Potion** can make you safer.



### 3. Synthesis and use (making your ultimate backpack)

Once you have collected enough shadow shells, you can start making shadow boxes.



#### A. Shadow Box Synthesis Formula

- **Material:** **2 hidden shadow shells** and **1 ordinary box (Chest)**.
- **Placement:** In the center of the workbench, place **box** in the middle and **2 hidden shadow shells** above and below the box respectively.
- **result:** Obtain **1 purple shadow box**.



#### B. Dyeing and stacking

- **dyeing:** The hidden shadow box can be synthesized with **Any kind of dye (Dye)** like armor to change the color.
- **Organizational management:** It is recommended to use different colors of hidden shadow boxes for **Classified storage**:
  - **blue:** Minerals (diamond, iron, gold).
  - **red:** Redstone component.
  - **green:** Farm products (food, crops).
  - **effect:** This way you can quickly find the resources you need by simply checking the colors.



### 4. Automation application of shadow box

The shadow box is not just a backpack, it is also a key component in the fields of redstone and automation.

- **Funnel compatibility:** The hidden shadow box can be sucked out of or injected into the item by **Hopper**.
- **Automatic unloading:** Complex automated warehouses usually use shadow boxes as **Input or output terminal**. You can design a system that will automatically be collected and replaced with a new empty box when the shadow box is full.
- **Mining efficiency:** When mining on a large scale, bringing a large number of shadow boxes will allow you to **No need to return to the base to clear your backpack within a few hours**.
