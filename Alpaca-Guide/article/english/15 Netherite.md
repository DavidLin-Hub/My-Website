## 👑 Netherite alloy - the power beyond diamonds (Netherite)



congratulations! Enter the Netherworld and survive, and prove that you are a true Minecraft master. Now, it’s time to pursue the ultimate power—**Netherite**!

Nether Alloy is currently in Minecraft survival mode **The best materials**, which can lift your diamond equipment to a whole new level.

### What is a lower bound alloy? (Properties of the Ultimate Material)



Nether alloy equipment (tools, weapons, armor) is more powerful and rare than diamond equipment.

- **Higher durability:** Much more durable than diamond equipment.
- **Higher efficiency/damage:** has higher excavation speed and weapon damage than diamonds.
- **Strongest feature: Fireproof!** The biggest feature of lower bound alloy items is that **It doesn't burn in magma!** If you unfortunately fall into magma in the lower boundary, your lower bound alloy equipment will float on the magma, giving you time to rescue items.
- **Will not be knocked back:** Wearing a complete Nether Alloy Armor, the knockback effect you are subjected to will be greatly reduced.

### ⛏️ Step 1: Find Ancient Debris



The lower bound alloy cannot be found directly in the lower boundary. It must be obtained through synthesis, and its core material is **Ancient Debris**.



#### 1. Distribution of ancient wreckage



- **Get the tool:** **A diamond pick or a netherworld pick must be used**.
- **Optimal Y coordinates:** Ancient wreckage is mainly generated in the depths of the lower realm. The most intensive excavation height is **Y Level 15**.
  - *(Press F3 in the lower bound to view the coordinates and keep your mining channel at a height of Y=15.)*
- **Rarity:** Ancient wreckage is much rarer than diamonds, and there are usually only 1-2 veins in a whole block (Chunk).



#### 2. The most efficient collection method: explosion!



The characteristic of ancient wreckage is **Will not be damaged by explosion** (but the surrounding lower boundary rock will be blown up), so **explode** is the fastest way to find it.

- **Method 1: Bed Mining**
  - **principle:** Since **Bed** will be **Explode immediately** when used in the lower bound and end (and has a huge explosion power), it is the most efficient collection tool.
  - **operate:** Stand at a safe distance, place a bed in the mine track with Y=15, then try right-clicking on the bed and back immediately! The explosion will clear the surrounding lower boundary rocks and reveal ancient wreckage.
- **Method 2: TNT blowing method**
  - **operate:** Made a large number of **TNT**, place along the ore duct and detonate with **Redstone Circuit** or **Flintstone**.

> **⚠️ Safety reminder:** Explosion collection method is very dangerous! Be sure to keep a distance far enough before the explosion and make sure you are behind cover (e.g. **obsidian**).

### ⚙️ Step 2: Frying and synthesizing alloy ingots



After collecting enough ancient wrecks (you need 4 ancient wrecks to synthesize 1 alloy ingot), return to the main world or safe Nether Base for processing.

1. **Fire ancient wreckage:**
   - Put **Ancient wreckage** into **Furnace** or **Blast Furnace**.
   - After firing, **Netherite Scrap** is obtained.
2. **Synthesize the lower bound alloy ingot:**
   - In **Workbench**, place **4 Nether alloy fragments** and **4 Gold Ingots** together.
   - You will get **1 Netherite Ingot**.

### 🔨 Step 3: Forge and upgrade equipment



Nether alloy ingots cannot be used directly to make equipment like diamonds. It must be used for existing diamond equipment.

1. **Making a forging table (Smithing Table)**:
   - **formula:** 4 boards + 2 iron ingots.
2. **To upgrade:**
   - Right-click **Forging table** to open the interface.
   - Put in your **Diamond equipment (tools, weapons or armor)**.
   - Put in **1 lower bound alloy ingot**.
   - Remove the upgraded **Nether alloy equipment**!

> **💡 Holy Alpaca Tips:** Upgraded Nether Alloy Equipment**All enchantments on the original diamond equipment will be retained!** Therefore, be sure to enchant your diamond equipment to the best, and then upgrade to Nether Alloy!

congratulations! You now have the best gear in the Minecraft world. The next target is **The End** and **The End Dragon (End Dragon)**, are you ready?
